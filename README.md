# Open multipul urls

Since you can't use window.open to open multipule urls, you have to use a chrome extension to implement that feature.

## Feature

- Open multiple urls simultaneously.
- Load and render page on tab focus.
- Extract url from text.
- Input text and options cached locally.

## Usage

1. Clone this project.

2. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
- Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
- Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
- Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.
